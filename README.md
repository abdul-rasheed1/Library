PROJECT LIBRARY FROM ODIN PROJECT

The task is to create an online libraray that stores key information about books a user has read or is yet to read
I am developing the mvp so far and trying to get the key features required by the assignment

KEY FEATURES 
1.ADD BOOK BUTTON - to add a book to the library
2.REMOVE BOOK BUTTON - to remove a book from the library
3.READ STATUS TOGGLE -  to change the status of the book depending on whether it's read or not

So far i have successfully created the "ADD BOOK BUTTON" to add a book to the library
working on "REMOVE BOOK BUTTON"
